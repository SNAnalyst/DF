#' 17 November Greece Bombing (dataset)
#' @description The dataset refers to the 17 November Revolutionary Organisation, 
#' a Marxist urban guerrilla organization operating in Greece. 
#' The data refer to the specific temporal window which runs from 1975 to 2002. 
#' During these years the group has been responsible for several violent acts 
#' such as assassinations, kidnappings and symbolic attacks on government offices.
#' The following has been reconstructed:
#' \preformatted{
#' 1) 2-mode matrix, binary, 15x12 persons by events. Ties are participation in terrorist events
#' 2) 1-mode stacked matrices 18x18 persons by persons, binary
#'    Kinship
#'    1975-1984
#'    1985-1994
#'    1995-2002
#' The original file presents a distinction among several types of relationships:
#'    1. Acquaintances/Distant family ties (interactions limited to radical organisation activities),
#'    2. Friends/Moderately close family ties (interactions extend beyond radical organisations to include such categories as co-workers and roommates). Operational/Organisational leadership (i.e. JI leadership, formally or informally ranking members of burgeoning cells).Operational Ties (i.e. worked closely on a bombing together).
#'    3. Close Friends/Family, Tight-knit operational cliques (would die for each other)
#' If one of these three types of relationships was present, it has been coded with 1.

#'Big Allied and Dangerous (BAAD) (dataset)
#'@description The Big Allied And Dangerous (BAAD) project focuses on creation and maintenance of a comprehensive database of terrorist organizational characteristics. This project has created two datasets. The first, BAAD Version 1.0 (BAAD1) contains a single snapshot of 395 terrorist organizations active (meaning they perpetrated at least one attack) between 1998-2005. This dataset grew from the information originally hosted by the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT) in their Terrorism Knowledge Base (TKB). BAAD1 improved and extended the data available from MIPT through independent verification and coding efforts. The dataset includes both case-by-variables information on each organization and network data. The case-by-variables dataset is available for download currently. The network data will be available for download during the second quarter of 2010. Big Allied and Dangerous, Version 2.0 (BAAD2) seeks to improve upon BAAD1 in multiple ways by (1) providing time series data in yearly slices, (2) expanding the time period forward through 2007, and (3) increasing the number and depth of variables collected and coded. BAAD2 is made up of two major components. The first is the data on organizational variables. These variables include: group name, aliases, homebase, ideology, size, age, structure, financial support, electoral involvement, leadership loss, territorial control, CBRN pursuit or use, and number of incidents, injuries, and fatalities. The second component is the social network data, which characterizes relations between terrorist organizations as well as between countries and terrorist organizations. Relationships are coded for categories such as: suspected ally, ally, faction, splinter group, rival, enemy, target, and state sponsor. This data can then be used to create dynamic network visualizations to show the networks evolving over the 10 years included in the dataset. Data construction for BAAD2 is currently ongoing.

#'Caviar (dataset)
#'@description Project Caviar was a unique investigation that targeted a network of hashish and cocaine importers operating out of Montreal. The network was targeted between 1994 and 1996 by a tandem investigation uniting the Montreal Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other national and regional law-enforcement agencies from various countries (i.e., England, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Paraguay, and Colombia). The case is unique because it involved a specific investigative approach that will be referred to as a 'seize and wait' strategy. Unlike most law-enforcement strategies, the mandate set forward in the Project Caviar case was to seize identified drug consignments, but not to arrest any of the identified participants. This took place over a 2-year period. Thus, although 11 importation consignments were seized at different moments throughout this period, arrests only took place at the end of the investigation. What this case offers is a rare opportunity to study the evolution of a criminal network phenomenon as it was being disrupted by law-enforcement agents. The inherent investigative strategy permits an assessment of change in the network structure and an inside look into how network participants react and adapt to the growing constraints set upon them.
#'The principal data source was comprised of information submitted as evidence during the trials of 22 participants in the Caviar network. It included 4,279 paragraphs of information (over 1,000 pages) revealing electronically intercepted telephone conversations between network participants. These transcripts were used to create the overall matrix of the drug-trafficking operation's communication system throughout the course of the investigation. Individuals falling in the surveillance net were not all participants in the trafficking operation. An initial extraction of all names appearing in the surveillance data led to the identification of 318 individuals. From this pool, 208 individuals were not implicated in the trafficking operations. Most were simply named during the many transcripts of conversations, but never detected. Others who were detected had no clear participatory role within the network (e.g., family members or legitimate entrepreneurs). The final network was thus composed of 110 participants.
#'NETWORK  11 1-mode matrices person by person, representing the 11 phases of the investigation. Ties are directed and valued. Number of nodes = 1) 15x15, 2) 24x24, 3) 33x33, 4) 33x33, 5) 32x32, 6) 27x27, 7) 34x34, 8) 42x42, 9) 34x34, 10) 42x42, 11) 41x41

#'CielNet (dataset)
#'@description Project Ciel is based on a small drug-importation network that was importing liquid hashish from Jamaica to Montreal. This network was targeted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Montreal Police from May 1996 to June 1997. Typical of many Canadian investigations of drug smuggling and trafficking, the operations in Project Ciel were described as taking place within a tightly governed organizational framework: a hierarchy, in short. Reports from the investigation maintained that the main target of the investigation was the 'organizational leader.' Other key targets included the leader's 'lieutenant' and a series of other subordinates. The investigation produced three separate seizures, with two taking place at Mirabel airport near Montreal and another occurring at Sangster airport in Jamaica. Overall, 75 people fell into the surveillance net. A selection process that was aimed at identifying only those individuals who were active in the drug-importation operations resulted in a final network of 25 participants.

#'Cocaine Smuggling (dataset)
#'@description Data refers to four groups involved in cocaine trafficking in Spain. Information comes from police wiretapping and meetings registered by police investigations of these criminal organisations between 2007 and 2009.
#'Operation MAMBO (N=22). The investigation started in 2006 and involved Colombian citizens that were introducing 50 kg of cocaine to be adulterated and distributed in Madrid (Spain). Ultimately, the group was involved in smuggling cocaine from Colombia through Brazil and Uruguay to be distributed in Spain. This is a typical Spanish middle cocaine group acting as wholesale supplier between a South American importer group and retailers in Madrid.
#'Operation JUANES (N=51). In 2009, the police investigation detected a group involved in the smuggling of cocaine from Mexico to be distributed in Madrid (Spain). In this case, the group operated in close cooperation with another organization that was laundering the illegal income from drug distribution from this and other groups. The cocaine traffickers earned an estimated EUR 60 million.
#'Operation JAKE (N=62). In 2008, the group investigated was operating as a wholesale supplier and retail distributor of cocaine and heroin in a large distribution zone located in Madrid (Spain), where gypsy clans traditionally carry out similar activities. The group was in charge of acquiring, manipulating and selling the drugs in the gypsy quarter.
#'Operation ACERO (N=11). This investigation started in 2007 and involved a smaller family-based group. The group was composed mainly of members of a same family and was led by a female. They distributed cocaine in Madrid (Spain) that was provided to them by other groups based in a northwest region of the country, one of the most active areas in the provision of cocaine from the countries of origin. The group also had their own procedures to launder money.

#' Montreal Street Gangs (dataset)
#'@description Data obtained from the Montreal Police's central intelligence base, the Automated Criminal Intelligence Information System (ACIIS), was used to reconstruct the organization of drug-distribution operations in Montreal North. These operations were targeted during three separate investigations between 2004 and 2007 by the Montreal Police, who believed that the criminal activities were under the control of one of the more reputed gangs in Montreal - the Bo-Gars (or Handsome Boys, in English). Because the trials extending from two of the investigations were still ongoing at the time of analysis, their names remain confidential and I simply refer to Investigations A, B, and C. Investigation A began in February 2004 and ended in April 2005, with the arrests of 27 individuals who were accused primarily of importing and distributing crack and cocaine in a Montreal North neighborhood. Investigation A was the largest of the three investigations under study and it was the only case to offer electronic surveillance information amongst the available data sources. Investigations B and C, which were direct extensions of observations made during Investigation A, both began during the fall of 2006 and ended in June 2007, with the arrests of 24 individuals who were targeted in Investigation B and 11 individuals targeted in Investigation C. Investigation B concentrated on street dealers of marijuana and crack, while Investigation C focused specifically on the activities of a group of wholesalers who were supplying some of the dealers targeted in Investigation B. Overall, 101 individuals were monitored during the investigations--45 in Investigation A, 30 in Investigation B, and 26 in Investigation C. This list of 101 individuals was used as a starting point to reconstruct the final network. This final network was comprised of 70 participants and was based on information obtained from three data sources.

We treated each relation as a tie and coded whether a tie exists between two members or not. Thus, the networks have, conceptually and technically, binary and symmetric relations between members.
#'Data also includes sociological information of members, such as gender, age, marital status, recruiting age, education (that is, attending university), brigade memberships, non-/violent characteristics, role-related characteristics--senior leader, IED constructor, IED planter, and gunman-and task-related characteristics (that is, foreign operation tasks, and involvement n bank robbery, kidnapping, hijacking, and drugs).

#' Suffragette movement in the UK (dataset)
#'@description Dataset collected by Gemma Edwards on the Suffragette movement in the UK. Relational data were constructed from historical archives, including suffragette letters and speeches, and secondary sources like published auto-biographies and newspaper accounts. This historical material provided not only relational data for quantitative network analysis about the structure of these networks, but rich, narrative accounts about the meaning of ties over time and the perception of the network from those within it. Using historical letters as a source of data on suffragette networks was seen as particularly useful for example, as letters contained relational data in terms of 'who was writing to whom', and writers would further 'talk their ties' within the course of letter writing. Also, letters tend to be dated, allowing for an analysis of the evolution of ties over time (Edwards and Crossley 2009).

#' Project Togo (dataset)
#'@description Project Togo began in February 1998 when a Toronto-based ringing operation was dismantled and one of its participants informed the police that he was previously employed by a Montreal businessman who was also active in the resale of stolen vehicles. This initial tip was corroborated soon after by a thief who had been arrested while driving a stolen vehicle. By December 1998, the Togo investigation was under way. It spanned into February 1999 and 20 cars that were destined for France, Ghana, and local buyers in southern Quebec were retrieved.

#' St. Louis Crimes (dataset)
#' @description In the 1990s Rick Rosenfeld and Norm White used police records to collect data on crime in St. Louis. They began with five homicides and recorded the names of all the individuals who had been involved as victims, suspects or witnesses. They then explored the files and recorded all the other crimes in which those same individuals appeared. This snowball process was continued until they had data on 557 crime events. Those events involved 870 participants of which: 569 appeared as victims 682 appeared as suspects 195 appeared as witnesses, and 41 were dual (they were recorded both as victims and suspects in the same crime. Their data appear, then, as an 870 by 557, individual by crime event matrix. Victims are coded as 1, suspects as 2, witnesses as 3 and duals as 4.

#' Mumbai Attack (2008) (dataset)

#' known as the 26/11 terror attack, was executed in Mumbai (India) 
#' by members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
#' Ten terrorists equipped with advanced weaponry and three handlers in Pakistan, 
#' were involved in the attack and five major locations in Mumbai were targeted,
#' causing nearly 260 casualties from ten different countries. 
#' The attack was well planned and handlers from Pakistan
#' were in communication with these terrorists, during the attack.
#' 
#' The dataset includes the names of the terrorists and their place of 
#' operation (termed \code{location}). 
#' The edges were constructed based on intercepted phone calls (who-called-whom).

#' Oversize mafia (dataset)
#' @description Dataset from operation Oversize, an Italian criminal case against
#' a mafia group. The investigation lasted from 2000 to 2006, and targeted 
#' suspects involved in international drug trafficking, homicides, and robberies. 
#' The trial started in 2007 and lasted until 2009, when the judgment was passed, 
#' and the main suspects were convicted with penalties from 5 to 22 years of 
#' imprisonment. 
#' Most suspects were affiliated to the 'Ndrangheta, a mafia from Calabria 
#' with ramifications in other regions and abroad.
#' 
#' Contrary to most empirical studies on criminal networks, 
#' which rely on data derived from a single source of information, 
#' Oversize's peculiarity lies in the availability of three networks from three 
#' judicial documents corresponding to three different stages of the criminal 
#' proceedings: the wiretap records (WR), the arrest warrant (AW), 
#' and the judgment (JU). 
#' The wiretap records include all wiretap conversations transcribed by the 
#' police and considered relevant at first glance. 
#' The arrest warrant contains a selection of the transcripts and other relevant
#' information from informants and other investigative activities (e.g. physical 
#' surveillance). 
#' The judgment summarizes the trial and includes information from several 
#' sources of evidence, including wiretapping and audio surveillance. 
#' 
#' The individuals involved in illicit activities constitute the nodes of the 
#' networks, the links indicate a relation between any two actors. 
#' The three networks consist of 182 nodes.

#' Montagna mafia (dataset)
#' @description Dataset collected by Cavallaro et al. (2020) derived from the 
#' pre-trial detention order, issued by the Court of Messina's preliminary 
#' investigation judge on March 14, 2007, which was towards the end of the 
#' major anti-mafia operation referred to as the "Montagna Operation".
#' 
#' This particular investigation was a prominent operation focused on two Mafia 
#' clans, known as the "Mistretta" family and the "Batanesi" clan. 
#' From 2003 to 2007, these families were found to had infiltrated several 
#' economic activities including major infrastructure works, 
#' through a cartel of entrepreneurs close to the Sicilian Mafia.
#' 
#' In the datasets, each node represents an individual, whereas links 
#' show mutual interactions among the individuals. 
#' The Meetings dataset, captures the physical meetings among suspects. 
#' The Phone Calls dataset refers to phone calls among individuals.
#' 
#' The networks are weighted since, for each pair of individuals, we recorded 
#' a coefficient representing the number of times the pair had a meeting
#'  (as reported by the police surveillance logs), and made a phone call 
#'  (reported in police interceptions logs). 
#'  
#'  Vertices may belong to different categories. 
#'  Some vertices represent the leaders (i.e., "bosses") or the soldiers 
#'  (i.e., "picciotti", a Sicilian word which refers to the lowest rank of the 
#'  Mafia hierarchy) of the criminal organization. 
#'  Other nodes are associated with individuals (e.g., a fruit seller or a baker) 
#'  who had one or more calls with members of a Mafia syndicate but are not 
#'  affiliated with any criminal organization.
#' 
#' The dataset contains a total of 144 vertices, 95 of which are active in the 
#' meetings graph and also 95 are active in the phone graph. 
#' The numbers are not exactly equal to the numbers reported in the paper where 
#' the data came from. It is unclear why.
#' The meetings graph has 289 edges, the phone graph has 150. 
#' Again, not exactly equal to the reported numbers in the source paper.
